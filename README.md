# Bank-loan-Analysis
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data using SQL, Excel, and Tableau. It aims to uncover key insights into loan applications, disbursements, repayments, and borrower demographics by examining various dimensions such as time, geography, and purpose. The analysis involves categorizing loans into 'Good' and 'Bad' based on repayment behavior, exploring trends in interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and loan statuses, and visualizing the findings through interactive dashboards. SQL Server is used for querying the dataset, while Excel supports data cleaning and preliminary analysis. Tableau provide interactive visualizations to help stakeholders understand and explore the bank’s loan portfolio performance. The project also outlines future work, including predictive modeling and deeper demographic analysis, to enhance strategic decision-making and improve lending strategies.
